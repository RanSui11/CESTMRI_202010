Updated on Nov. 2nd 2020

### Authors: 

Ran Sui, Jiadi Xu

### Matlab version: 

9.7.0.1261785 (R2019b) Update 3

### Code Description:

1. Add toolbox and tensorlab_2016-03-28 into the path

2. Apply amide.m and amide_process.m to obtain amide information; Apply noe.m and noe_process.m to obtain noe information. The data files used in the code, excluding subjects' information, are samples of this project.

3. After running all the codes, we can get a B0 map, a T1 map, a Z map, a R map, NOE map, RNOE map and Z spectrums for amide and noe respectively.
